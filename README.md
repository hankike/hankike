Hi! My name is Hank Eichstaedt and I am a sports statistician. 
I work primarily in baseball data, however I have experience in football, basketball, volleyball, and soccer as well. I am from Joliet, Illinois and currently am in the Indianapolis area.
I graduated from Louisiana State University in 2024 with a mathematics major and statistics minor. While at LSU, I worked with their baseball team (2022-2024), football (2023-2024), and women's basketball (2022-2024) while helping out with almost every other team on campus as well!
